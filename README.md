# AI-training-Q-learning
For this program, I was given starter code to utilize Q-learning to train an agent to navigate through a maze to find treasure. I started each epoch by randomly selecting a cell to place the AI. As long as the game was not over, I had the agent take a random action if a random number generated was below the epsilon, or the agent would take the best predicted action based on its state. The state, reward, game status, action, and previous state were recorded by using a remember function that would help calculate the best action to improve the agent over time. I recieved the inputs and targets of the data and evaluated their losses. If the agent won a game, a win would be added to its history, while a loss would be added if the agent loses. Using the wins and losses of the agent, its win rate was calculated and used to continue the game until the agent recieved a win rate of 100%.
